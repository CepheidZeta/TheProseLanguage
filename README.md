For testing, simply download only three of the files:

- `sample_input.txt`
- `prose.exe`
- `prose_handler.exe`

Ensure that they are in the same directory/folder.

Once ready, you will only need to run `prose_handler.exe`.

Windows 10/11 may give you a warning about running `prose_handler.exe`, but you can ignore the warning.
